<h2>Why CitizenRoom?</h2>
The <strong>Citizens’Band</strong> was born for collective private use and saw the day in 1945 in the USA. CB was one of the several radio services regulated by the federal communications commission (FCC) with the goal to allow citizens to use a band of radio frequencies for <strong>personal communication</strong> (e.g. radio-controlled models, chats within family and friends, undersized businesses) <strong><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_band_radio'> >> source Wikipedia</a></strong>.
<br><br>

Citizenroom is born with the idea to disrupt the way we use part of the web today, proposing an open-source service, free from any engagement with a public or private intermediary, applying the same CB model. This means that, as opposed to what happens today within the web (whatever you’re using paying or free interfaces), none of your personal information is given or stolen. This results in developing a service of audio and video communication to be dedicated to personal interactions between citizens.<br><br>

Citizenroom is a platform where you can create virtual rooms in which you have the possibility to set-up meetings (audio and video) with a theoretical unlimited number of participants: however, it is strongly recommended to limit the use of the today available prototype to a maximum of <strong>30 people simultaneously</strong> to make it work properly.<br><br>

Citizenroom is completely <strong>free, open source and you can use it without any personal account creation</strong> or applications download (desktop or mobile): you can easily create an unlimited number of rooms and, just in a click, you can generate an invitation link ready to be shared with anyone you want to invite in the room. On the other side, the people you invite to join will have access to the room just clicking on your link and they won’t be forced to create an account or install any software on their device.<br>
We strongly felt the need to create and test a platform that focused rather on <strong>simplicity</strong> than on the personalization of the service.<br><br>

<h2>DATA MANAGEMENT</h2>
<strong>Citizenroom doesn’t keep or store any user, device, or conversation data</strong>. This doesn’t mean that Citizenroom is a platform where total anonymity can be enjoyed, and despite the fact that the platform is free, it is completely <strong>unencrypted</strong>. At all times, in the event of an incorrect and/or illegal exchange of information, <strong>any conversation may be monitored by a competent authority</strong>. Citizenroom aims to be a simple and immediate communication tool, but not a way to mask or fake your identity for illicit purposes or against the law of the Country where the platform is located or where people are connected from.<br><br>

<h2>CITIZENROOM BUSINESS</h2>
We are also testing a version (<strong>free as well</strong>) that we decided to identify as <strong>Business</strong> in which you can create a personal account (by entering a valid email only): in this version, having an account allows you to create personal rooms to be used for different purposes: for your work group, your association, your family.<br>
To make an example: while creating a room indicated by the number 35, this room 35 will only belong to your account and it won’t share the participants with the room indicated by the same number (35) in the basic Citizenroom version. In other words, within a personal account, you can create unique personal rooms to be used in an unlimited way.<br><br>
In the business version you will have the possibility to customize the rooms with a title and a logo and to establish 3 different levels of access to your rooms:<br>
<ul>
<li>Activating the lobby option</li>
<li>Setting up an access password</li> 
<li>With a ticketing system (pre-establishing a list of identified nicknames to be invited)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Civic halls</h2>
Starting from March 15, 2022 we have put on line the section dedicated to <strong>Civic halls</strong>: through this section you will have the opportunity to enter and use a CitizenRoom dedicated to a <strong>municipality</strong>.<br>
The idea is to donate to each municipality (for now only in Italy and France) a CitizenRoom to which <strong>the administration and all citizens can freely access</strong>, without the need to create an account, to share personal information or to install a software: an additional simple and free tool for building a <strong>participation</strong> and a <strong>digital citizenship</strong>.<br><br>
The section was made possible thanks to the data collected and made available by:<br>
<ul>
<li>Repository of <a href='https://github.com/opendatasicilia/comuni-italiani'>Italian Municipalities of OpenDataSicilia</a></li>
<li><a href='https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/geologos/'>GeoLogos</a> of the French Public Data Open Platform (data.gouv.fr)</li>
<li><a href='https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/communes-de-france-base-des-codes-postaux/'>Communes de France</a>of the French Public Data Open Platform (data.gouv.fr)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Collaborative whiteboard</h2>
Each room gives access to a collaborative whiteboard, shared with all users of the room.
This functionality is possible thanks to the Open Source project<a href='https://wbo.ophir.dev/'>WBO</a> by <a href='https://ophir.dev/'>Ophir LOJKINE</a>.<br><br>

<h2>AN OPEN SOURCE PROTOTYPE</h2>
Citizenroom is a prototype web conference platform, based on jitsi meet public api, written in php/javascript and completely open source.<br>
You can read the prototype code and, if you believe it is necessary, propose to modify it on Github in the <a href='https://github.com/gvincenzi/citizenroom'>dedicated repository</a>.
